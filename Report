## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an AI-powered diagnostic system to classify brain tumor types from MRI images. It leverages a hybrid modeling approach: ResNet50 for deep image-based feature extraction and MLJAR AutoML for structured data classification. This approach aims to improve diagnostic accuracy, minimize human error, and reduce the time required for manual diagnosis, offering a scalable solution for healthcare applications.

  
## Executive Summary
The "AI-Driven Brain Tumor Classification" project addresses a significant challenge in the medical imaging domainâ€”enhancing the accuracy and speed of diagnosing brain tumors using MRI scans. Leveraging ResNet50, a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, and MLJAR AutoML, an automated model optimization framework, our team developed a hybrid AI pipeline to detect three tumor types: Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary tumor. The approach was selected for its ability to combine the representational power of image-based deep learning with the flexibility and accuracy of structured AutoML techniques.

Key components of the pipeline include: preprocessing of MRI images, transfer learning using ResNet50 to extract features, transformation of features into structured tabular data, and classification through MLJAR AutoML in 'Compete' mode. The best-performing model, Random Forest, achieved a log loss of 0.63 and accuracy of ~88%, significantly improving upon the 26% baseline from Assignment 2.

Visualizations such as confusion matrices, classification reports, and performance trend plots were created to communicate results. The outputs are intuitive, stakeholder-friendly, and provide valuable diagnostic insights for clinical and research settings. Conceptual extensions including Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) were explored, emphasizing future applications in adaptive diagnostic systems.


## Goal
The primary goal is to create an automated classification system for brain tumors visible in MRI scans. The hybrid solution involves using ResNet50, a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet, for image feature extraction, followed by MLJAR AutoML to handle model training, optimization, and evaluation. This architecture improves model accuracy, generalization, and robustness.

  
## Intended Audience
This project is aimed at:
- Clinical researchers and radiologists
- AI/ML engineers focused on healthcare
- Medical educators and students
- Hospital administrators and MedTech decision-makers


## Strategy & Pipeline Steps
1. **Preprocessing:** MRI images were resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized.
2. **Transfer Learning:** Features extracted using ResNet50 with frozen early layers.
3. **Dataset Splitting:** Stratified sampling into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.
4. **AutoML Modeling:** Features reshaped and fed into MLJAR AutoML for classification.
5. **Evaluation:** Results measured using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
6. **Comparison:** Benchmarked against Assignment 2 prototype and published research.

## Challenges
- **Class imbalance** resolved via augmentation (rotation, flipping).
- **Limited dataset size** addressed through transfer learning.
- **Lack of GPU** mitigated by optimizing batch sizes and freezing layers.


## Problem Statement
Brain tumors are a serious medical concern requiring early and accurate classification to guide treatment decisions. Manual diagnosis through MRI scan analysis is often time-consuming and prone to human error. This project addresses the need for a faster, more consistent, and accurate classification system using artificial intelligence. The focus is on classifying four types of brain MRI images: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor, with an emphasis on building a model that supports clinical needs for precision and reliability.

To achieve this, we implemented a hybrid approach combining the ResNet50 deep learning model with MLJAR AutoML. ResNet50 was fine-tuned on MRI images to extract features and perform direct image classification, while MLJAR AutoML was used to analyze structured image data for automated model selection and tuning. This combination leverages both deep learning and AutoML for optimal performance. While we initially intended to include Grad-CAM visualizations to enhance model explainability, this component was not implemented due to time constraints.

## Dataset
The dataset used was sourced from Kaggle and contains T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI images divided into four classes (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, Normal). All images were organized into structured subfolders for training and validation via Google Drive.


## Implementation Overview
- Mounted Google Drive to load images.
- Unified datasets into one folder with four subcategories.
- Visualized samples for each tumor type.
- Used `ImageDataGenerator` for 80/20 train-validation split.
- Constructed ResNet50-based CNN model.
- Trained for 5 epochs (accuracy: ~63%, val_acc: ~64%).
- Evaluated with confusion matrix and classification report (F1-score: 0.32 avg).


## MLJAR AutoML Pipeline
- ResNet50 features flattened and reshaped.
- MLJAR AutoML initiated in 'Compete' mode.
- Best model: Random Forest (logloss: 0.63, accuracy: ~88%).
- AutoML steps included ensembling and stacking.


## Visualizations & Results
- Confusion matrix and heatmaps used.
- Accuracy/loss plotted across epochs.
- Accuracy improved from 26% (Assignment 2) to ~88%.
- Visuals and documentation support both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


## Conceptual Enhancement
**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** is proposed as an enhancement. Future diagnostic systems should adapt autonomously, interpret unseen MRI patterns, and reason across institutions. AGI aligns with this vision, surpassing the capabilities of narrow AI systems.


## Lessons Learned
- AutoML saves time and improves performance.
- Transfer learning with ResNet50 is efficient for small medical datasets.
- More epochs and feature selection will further improve accuracy.
